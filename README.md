# .emacs

## This is an absolutely minimalistic emacs config (for me actually)

I use emacs on different hosts - OSX, Win, Sol, Lin, and  I need a portable config.
This different configs weight about 1-1,5k lines initially.

## Usefull notes:

* M-x occur - show minibuffer with searched results then type C-c C-f to activate folowing mode
* C-x C-n / C-u 1 C-x C-n - on and off the goal column
* C-x n n / C-x n w - turn on and off region narrowing
* M-x hs-minor-mode - turns hide/show mode for code folding
* C-u 16 C-x $ / C-x $ - code folding via indent level (selective display)
* C-u NUM is equivalent to M-NUM
* M-!, M-& - different output for exec commands
* C-x C-v - revert-buffer trick
